## 📌 Overview

`datadriven-portfolio` is a customizable, **data-driven personal portfolio** built with React. It was originally designed as a personal portfolio, but is being developed as a **reusable template** for anyone to showcase their work — **without writing a single line of code**.

This project lets you **modify all content via a simple JSON file**, making it easy for developers and non-developers alike to personalize their portfolio in minutes.
