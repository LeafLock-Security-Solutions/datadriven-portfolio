# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently in the early planning and setup phase.  
No official releases have been made yet, and security support will begin once the first stable version is released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it privately by emailing:

üìß **charanravela1998@gmail.com**

We aim to respond to valid security reports within **2 working days**, and to resolve confirmed issues within **14 days**, depending on the complexity and severity.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate effectively, please include as much of the following as possible:
- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- The potential impact (e.g., data exposure, unauthorized access, etc.)
- A proof-of-concept, if available
- Any suggestions for a fix or mitigation (optional)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** approach:
- You report the issue to us privately
- We investigate and patch the vulnerability
- We publish a fix and may credit your contribution (with your permission)

Please give us reasonable time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

## Thank You üôè

Thank you for helping to keep this project and its future users safe!  
Responsible security research is appreciated and respected.
