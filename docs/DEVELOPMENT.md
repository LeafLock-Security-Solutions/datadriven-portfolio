# 🛠️ Development Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for **datadriven-portfolio**. This document explains how to set up the project locally using Docker, run it in development mode, and understand the code structure.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeafLock-Security-Solutions/datadriven-portfolio.git
cd datadriven-portfolio
```

### 2. Build and Start the Dev Container

Ensure you have **Docker** and **Dev Containers (VS Code Extension)** installed.

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. When prompted, reopen in container — or manually:

```bash
# If using devcontainers CLI
devcontainer open .
```

3. VS Code will build the container using `Dockerfile` and `devcontainer.json`.

> ℹ️ First-time setup may take a few minutes to pull images and install dependencies.

### 3. Start the Development Server (inside container)

Once inside the dev container terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar port).

---

## 🌐 Environment Variables

The app reads the remote JSON config file through an environment variable:

```env
VITE_PUBLIC_DATA_URL=https://yourdomain.com/your-portfolio.json
```

You can define this in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```bash
# .env
VITE_PUBLIC_DATA_URL=https://charanravela.com/data.json
```

Make sure your JSON file is publicly accessible.

## 🧾 Scripts

| Script         | Description                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `dev`          | Starts local dev server          |
| `build`        | Creates a production build       |
| `preview`      | Previews the production build    |
| `format`       | Formats all files using Prettier |
| `format:check` | Checks formatting consistency    |
| `lint`         | Runs ESLint on all files         |
| `lint:fix`     | Runs ESLint and fixes issues     |

---

## 🌍 Preview Mode

To simulate the production version locally:

```bash
npm run build        # Must be run first
npm run preview      # Starts the preview server at http://localhost:4173
```

> ⚠️ If you skip the build step, the preview server will not work as it depends on the compiled output in the `dist/` folder.

## 🦪 Testing _(Coming Soon)_

Testing support and examples will be added in future versions.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Dev Server Not Loading in Browser?

If the terminal shows the app is running at `http://0.0.0.0:5173`, but the browser says **"site can't be reached"**, try this instead:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

This can happen on some systems (especially Windows with Docker/WSL).
